<h1>Nathan Hansle</h1>
<p>I’m a computer science student who enjoys problem-solving and building things that actually work and matter. Outside of school, I spend a lot of my free time gaming, which I enjoy both for fun and for the strategic thinking it involves. I also play tennis, which helps me stay active and disciplined while giving me a good balance from screen time. Overall, I’m someone who likes to challenge myself, improve my skills, and grow both mentally and physically.</p>
